# Things I learned when building this

This was my first ever project I've built and I learned A LOT during this process.  
Here are the main things that I learned:  
- React.js
- Node.js / Express.js
- OAuth
- API calling 

It was a really rewarding process to struggle through and learn everything.  
I spent a lot of time doing things that were not efficient whatsoever and slowly refactoring my code to work easier with the rest of my components.
