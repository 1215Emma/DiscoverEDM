This is my first attempt at a project using React.Js 
The goal is to create a website that can search through EDM artists/DJ's to find the places they're playing at in the future. 

Some things I want to achieve: 
1. sort by location
2. sort by genres
3. sort alphabetically/filters
4. sort by dates
5. links to samples of their music via youtube or spotify 
6. some information about the location of the event
7. I want to create a aethetically pleasing scroll functionality   to search through the DJs/Events instead of a simple dropdown
8. Link of where to buy tickets 

A lot of these things I'm really not sure how to gather the data besides pulling it manually but I know theres a way to search through event pages and grab info. I'll figure that out when the time comes.
